                      <p>Besides from liking K-pop, i've been reading since i was a child. I owned a mini library at home where i share it with my brother. These are some of the books that i bought and currently reading.
                        My mom thought me and my brother to read a lot and this has become my comfort ever since. I have my own Instagram where i dedicated to book which called as "Bookstagram". For the time being, i'm taking a break from 
                        updating my social media. :)

                      <p>Since i love K-pop, i tend to get myself into some events such as cupsleeve event or birthday event handled by the fans in the same fandom.
                        Thia video is a recent video where i got myself into a cupsleeve event with my friend. Due to covid situation, the cafe that handled this kind of event only
                        accept small amount of people. However, it didn't stop me from finding a new friends and hunt for freebies! xD

                      <p>Besides buying and collecting books, i do also collect photocards and albums of my favourite group. Each of the photocard is from different era and albums
                        and different prices. Some people find it weird to collect it but it is just the same as some people collected Pokemon cards or STarbucks tumbler. Aslong as it makes me happy,
                        i don't it should be a problem for others to feel offended by my collections.
